### Today's Topics

### Notes

Grab a pair and work together on the three OO labs (My Pets, Kickstarter and Banking). If you're already done reinforce what you've learned by helping someone else.  When you're pair is done, you are free to continue working on the remaining OO material. The goal is to get through Object Relationships and Object Architecture by lunch. Then, we'll do our first Workshop (Communication!!!) and review the 3 OO labs.

### Objectives

- Understand object-oriented relationships
- Use has_many and belongs_to
- Understand how objects encapsulate code and clarify responsibility
