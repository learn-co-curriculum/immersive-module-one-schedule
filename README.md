# Module One Schedule

Sample schedule for module one. Each day has a 'Today's Topics' sections which corresponds to a Topic name in the 'Immersive 2.0 Module One' Track. Each day, students should focus on the labs in these sections. Any missed labs can be made up on nights/weekends later in the week.
